# subgridADCIRCUtility
This set of scripts will create subgrid input files for subgrid enabled ADCIRC.

## Example:

The following link will take you to a data repository (need to figure out where to put this) where you will find an example folder containing a text control file and a python script used to call the subgrid calculator for a ADCIRC mesh of Galveston Bay, TX along with several other datafiles needed to perform the subgrid calulations.

1. The control file lists:
  - The outputfile name for the subgrid lookup table.
  - The ADCIRC mesh file.
  - A flag saying whether or not you are using default mannings n values.
  - If not using default mannings n values you need to add a line with the filename of the non-defualt table.
  - The minimum and maximum water surface elevations over which to calculate the subgrid.
  - The discretization step of the water surface elevations.
  - The number of DEMs used in the calulation.
  - The DEM file(s) used in the subgrid calulation.
  - The number of landcover files used in the calulation.
  - The landcover file(s) used in the calulation.

2. The python script reads the control file, calls the subgrid calulator and then simplifies the lookup table.
  - To call the subgrid calculator you will need to use the calculateSubgridCorrection command. The code should begin running and print what element and DEM it is looping through to keep you updated on the process.
  - At the end it will create a NetCDF file in the directory given by the control file. 

3. Other files contained within the data repo include:

  - 10 m resolution DEM and Landcover .tif files of Galevston Bay.
  - A relatively coarse ADCIRC mesh file, nodal attribute file, and fort.15 file for use with subgrid ADCIRC.
  - Some visualizations of subgrid ADCIRC and Conventional ADCIRC run on this domain.
  - Fully completed subgrid NetCDF lookup files to compare your results to.
  - A mannings n table with non-default values.
